# Conference Standings    

### Question 1  

**QUESTION:** What is the overall win % to one decimal place (e.g. 41.3%, 74.9%) of teams in the Western Conference against teams in the Eastern Conference through the 2005-2020 regular seasons? If the West has more wins than losses against the East, your answer should be a number greater than 50% and vice versa.  

```{r, Q1}
agg_standings <- aggregate(list(conference_wins = standings$wins),
                           list(conference=standings$conference), 
                           sum) 
total_wins = agg_standings$conference_wins[agg_standings$conference == "West"] + agg_standings$conference_wins[agg_standings$conference == "East"]
Q1_percent <- agg_standings$conference_wins[agg_standings$conference == "West"] / total_wins * 100
```


**ANSWER 1:** 52.1%     

### Question 2  

**QUESTION:** Out of the past 16 years (2005-2020), how many years has the Western Conference had more wins than losses against the East?    

```{r, Q2}
agg2_standings <- aggregate(list(conference_wins = standings$wins),
                           list(conference=standings$conference, 
                                season = standings$season), 
                           sum) 
west_better <- 0
east_better <- 0
diff_west_east_current <- 0
diff_west_east_extreme <- 0
diff_west_east <- c(0)

all_single_season <- data.frame(0, 0)
names(all_single_season)<-c("season","total_season_wins")

for (year in 2005:2020)
{
  single_season <- agg2_standings %>% filter(season == year)
  if (single_season$conference_wins[single_season$conference == 'West'] > single_season$conference_wins[single_season$conference == 'East'])
  {
    west_better <- west_better + 1  
    diff_west_east_current <- single_season$conference_wins[single_season$conference == 'West'] - single_season$conference_wins[single_season$conference == 'East']
    diff_west_east <- append(diff_west_east, diff_west_east_current)
    if (diff_west_east_extreme < diff_west_east_current)
    {
      diff_west_east_extreme <- diff_west_east_current
    }
  } else{
    east_better <- east_better + 1
    # print(year)
    diff_west_east_current <- single_season$conference_wins[single_season$conference == 'West'] - single_season$conference_wins[single_season$conference == 'East']
    diff_west_east <- append(diff_west_east, diff_west_east_current)
    if (diff_west_east_extreme < abs(diff_west_east_current))
    {
      diff_west_east_extreme <- abs(diff_west_east_current)
    }
  }
  
  single_season_agg <- aggregate(list(total_season_wins = single_season$conference_wins), 
                               list(season = single_season$season),
                               FUN=sum)
  
  all_single_season <- rbind(all_single_season, single_season_agg)
}

print (west_better); # print (east_better)

```


**ANSWER 2:** 15 out of 16 years.  

### Question 3  

**QUESTION:** In which year was the disparity between the conferences most extreme? What was the inter conference win-loss record (in the format WEST WINS - EAST WINS) in that year?  

```{r, Q3}
all_single_season$diffwins_west_east <- diff_west_east
agg2_standings %>% filter(season == 2013)
```

**ANSWER 3:** 2013, 674 - 556.  

### Question4  

**QUESTION:** For each season, find the playoff team with the lowest win % in each conference. What is the average win % of these teams from each conference over the 2005-2020 time period? In the case of ties within a season/conference pair, choose just one team.  

For example, from the 2020 season, we would include Memphis from the West (38-34, 52.8%) and Washington from the East (34-38, 47.2%).  

```{r, Q4}

                                               sum)

total <- agg_playoffs_no8seed_summary_west$total_wins + agg_playoffs_no8seed_summary_west$total_losses

                                                    total_losses = playoffs_no8seed_summary_east$losses), 
                                               list(conference = playoffs_no8seed_summary_east$conference), 
                                               sum)

agg_playoffs_no8seed_summary_east$avg_win_percent <- agg_playoffs_no8seed_summary_east$total_wins/total * 100
``` 

**ANSWER 4:**  

WEST: 55.2% 
EAST: 48.5%   

### Question 5  

**QUESTION:** Create a ggplot graph showing the record / win % of playoff and non-playoff teams against playoff and non-playoff teams from the **other** conference each season.  

For example, your graph should include a visual representation of how Western Conference playoff teams have done against Eastern Conference non-playoff teams each season (as well as other combinations of conference and playoffs).

### Question 6  

**QUESTION:** Write up to two sentences describing any takeaways you have from your visual above that you could send in a group email to the data science department.    

**ANSWER 6:**  

In the past 16 seasons, considering the records among playoff teams, represented by the red line in the figure above, and the ones among non-playoff teams, represented by the blue line, teams in the west conference have a better chance of winning against the ones in the east conference by 7.2% and 5.5% correspondingly. On the other hand, considering the other two combinations of playoff teams against non-playoff teams, represented by the green and orange lines, the ones in the west conference still outperform the ones in the east conference by 10.1%, calculated by 78.2% - (100% - 31.9%).   

# Point Margins and Schedules  

### Question 7  

In this next series of questions we are going to look at the strength of schedule by examining teams' opponents' point margins.  

First, calculate the average point margin for each team's opponents in each year, weighting by the number of times the teams played. For example, if team A played against team B once and team C twice, and team B had a season average point margin of +2 and team C had a season average point margin of -3, team A's opponents would have an average point margin of (2 - 3 - 3) / 3 = -1.33. There is no need to display the results of this calculation here, you are going to use it for the next few questions.  

```{r, calculate point margins, warning=FALSE}
standings$point_margins <- standings$points_scored_per_game - standings$points_allowed_per_game
team_v_team_okc <- team_v_team[,c("season", "bb_ref_team_name", "OKC")]
team_v_team_okc_2016 <- team_v_team_okc %>% filter(season == 2016)

for (row_ind in 1:30)
{
  team_v_team_okc_2016$games[row_ind] <- sum(as.numeric(unlist(str_split(team_v_team_okc_2016[row_ind,"OKC"],"-"))))
}

for (team_name in team_v_team_okc_2016$bb_ref_team_name)
{
  team_v_team_okc_2016$point_margins[team_v_team_okc_2016$bb_ref_team_name == team_name] <- standings$point_margins[standings$bb_ref_team_name == team_name & standings$season == 2016]
}
team_v_team_okc_2016$games[is.na(team_v_team_okc_2016$games)] <- 0
# sum(team_v_team_okc_2016$games)
team_v_team_okc_2016$total_point_margins <- team_v_team_okc_2016$games * team_v_team_okc_2016$point_margins 
```


**QUESTION:** What was OKC's opponents' average point margin (to two decimal places) in the 2016 season?  

```{r, Q7}
avg_point_margins <- sum(team_v_team_okc_2016$total_point_margins) / 82
```

**ANSWER 7:** 0.32     

### Question 8  

**QUESTION:** As close as you can, reproduce the following plot. There is one point on the plot for each team/season combination.    

**ANSWER 8:**

### Question 9  

**QUESTION:** Write no more than 4 sentences explaining this plot and two takeaways to a non-technical member of the organization.  

**ANSWER 9:** Each point in the figure represents each team in the seasons from 2005 to 2020. The more close the point is to the top-right corner, the more points the team (that the point stands for) scores than the points it allows, as the x-axis, in a more strong strength level of schedule, as the y-axis. Given the same strength level of schedule, teams in the west conference generally win by more points compared with teams in the east conference. The two points representing Los Angeles Lakers in 2019 and Dallas Mavericks in 2011 are very close to the top-right corner, which stands for they are both very competitive teams, and they both won NBA championships in the corresponding seasons.


### Question 10  


**PART (a):** What do you conclude about the relative strength of schedule for the two labeled teams (DAL 2011 and LAL 2019) (compared to all the rest of the teams) at the top of the plot? Please answer in 1 sentence.     

**ANSWER 10 (a):**  Given the same strength level of schedule, meaning the same value in the y-axis, DAL 2011 and LAL 2019 are separately the best teams in outscoring their opponents. 

**PART (b):** Do you have any hypotheses as to why teams from 2019 and 2011 appear at the extremes of this graph? Please answer in no more than 3 sentences.    

**ANSWER 10 (b):**  As the number of total games played, the sample size, reduced in these two seasons, the extreme cases, the outliners, are more likely to happen. Teams in the 2011 season play fewer games, reducing from 82 to 66 games, due to the NBA lockout. Same for the 2019 season, due to COVID-19, only selected teams keep playing games in Bubble.

# Logistic Regression   

### Question 11  

**QUESTION:** Fit a logistic regression model on all of the data 2005-2020 predicting the chance a team makes the playoffs from only its win % in that season. What are the coefficients?   

```{r, Q11}
standings$playoffs_num <- 0
standings$playoffs_num[standings$playoffs == "Yes"] <- 1

model1 <- glm(playoffs_num ~ win_pct, data = standings, family = binomial(link = logit))
# summary(model1)

# the below model might be more appropriate for interpretation
standings$win_pct100 <- standings$win_pct*100
model2 <- glm(playoffs_num ~ win_pct100, data = standings, family = binomial(link = logit))
# summary(model2)
```


**ANSWER 11:** Intercept: -20.88, win_pct: 42.40   

### Question 12  

**QUESTION:** Using your model from the previous question, what is the probability that a team with exactly a 50% win rate will make the playoffs (rounded to the nearest decimal, e.g. 44.7%)?   

```{r, Q12}
test_data <- standings[standings$win_pct == 0.5,][1,]
predict(model1, test_data,type='response')*100
```


**ANSWER 12:** 58.0%.   

### Question 13  

Add a indicator variable called `is_west` to your regression model that is TRUE if the team is in the Western Conference.    

```{r, add indicator to logistic regression model}
standings$is_west <- FALSE
standings$is_west[standings$conference == "West"] <- TRUE
# sum(standings$is_west)
```

**QUESTION:** What is the `is_west` coefficient and what does it mean? What is the prediction to the nearest decimal for a team in the East and a team in the West with a 50% win rate?  

```{r, Q13}
model3 <- glm(playoffs_num ~ win_pct + is_west, data = standings, family = binomial(link = logit))
summary(model3)

# to interpret the meaning of coeficient of the is_west predictor, we shall center the win_pct100 from model2
standings$win_pct100_centered <- standings$win_pct100 - mean(standings$win_pct100)
model_inter <- glm(playoffs_num ~ win_pct100_centered + is_west, data = standings, family = binomial(link = logit))
summary(model_inter)
# the probability to make the playoffs for east conference team (is_west = 0)
logit_ori <- exp(1.60)*exp(0.54)
prob_ori <- logit_ori / (1 + logit_ori) *100

# the probability to make the playoffs for west conference team (is_west = 1)
logit <- exp(1.60)*exp(0.54)*exp(-2.88) 
prob <- logit / (1 + logit) * 100


test_data_2 <- standings[standings$win_pct == 0.5,][c(1,5),]
predict(model3, test_data_2,type='response')*100
```

**ANSWER 13:**    
The coefficient is -2.875. Explanation: considering a team in the east conference with the average winning percentage, the probability that the team makes playoffs is 89.5%. However, when the team is in the west conference with the same winning percentage, the probability that this team makes playoffs will drop 57.2% to 32.3%. That is the effect of the coefficient of is_west in this model based on our dataset. 

EAST: 83.4%   
WEST: 22.1%   

### Question 14  

We are going to investigate whether it's possible that the relationship you found in the previous question could be reasonably explained by randomness. We're only looking at 30 teams over 16 years, so sample size might be a concern. To do this, you will perform a permutation test.  

For each of 10,000 iterations, randomly reorder the conference labels so that in each iteration, there are 15 random teams labeled as East and 15 teams labeled as West. For example, in a given iteration, we might have assigned OKC to the East and BKN to the West, but MIA might still be assigned to East. For each iteration, fit a new logistic regression model with the same variables as in question 13 (predicting making the playoffs from win % and `is_west`) and extract the `is_west` coefficient. Save all 10,000 `is_west` coefficients in a vector or dataframe.   

```{r, permutation test calculations}
standings$random_conference <- standings$conference
coef_random_is_west <- c()
for (iter in 1:10000)
{
  # random order the conference label, 15 teams as West and 15 as East
  # sample the conference variable in the first 30 rows
  standings$random_conference[1:30] <- sample(standings$conference[1:30])
  
  # based on the first 30 rows (season 2020) to decide each team in previous seasons shall be in which conference
  for (row_ind in 31:480)
  {
    standings$random_conference[row_ind] <- standings$random_conference[standings$season == 2020 & standings$team_short == standings$team_short[row_ind]]  
  }
  # regression model
  standings$random_is_west <- FALSE
  standings$random_is_west[standings$random_conference == "West"] <- TRUE
  sum(standings$random_is_west)
  
  model4 <- glm(playoffs_num ~ win_pct + random_is_west, data = standings, family = binomial(link = logit))
  summary(model4)
  # extract the cofficient of is_west
  coef_random_is_west <- append(coef_random_is_west, model4$coefficients[3])
}
df_random_is_west <- data.frame(coef_random_is_west)
```

**PART (a):** Make a ggplot comparing these 10,000 randomized `is_west` coefficients to the `is_west` coefficient you observed in question 13.  

**ANSWER 14 (a):**  
```{r, permutation test ggplot, fig.height=7, fig.width=10,fig.align ="center"}  
ggplot(df_random_is_west, aes(x=coef_random_is_west)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title="Coefficient of is_west Variable",
             x="Coefficient Value",
             y="Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

**PART (b):** What do you conclude from your plot? Please answer in no more than 3 sentences.  

**ANSWER 14 (b):**  The value of the coefficient of the is_west variable appears to follow a normal distribution with a mean around zero. This means that in the conditions of randomly reordering the conference label and running numbers of iterations, whether a team is in the West conference or not nearly has no impact on whether the team can make the playoffs. 

# Short Answer (Modeling)  

### Question 15  

Two rookies come into the league and each play the same number of minutes. Rookie A shot 37/100 from 3 and rookie B shot 20/50 from 3. The general manager asks you which player you expect to be a better three point shooter long term. You have a week to work on this hypothetical project.  

**PART (a):** What kind of data and information would you collect in order to answer this? Describe the features you'd use and the model you'd build to answer the question. You don't need to actually do the work here, just describe your process. Please limit your response to no more than 5 sentences.

**ANSWER 15 (a):**   The data I would collect include 1) the shooting location for the made and missed three-pointers, which helps us know if the player relies more on the corner threes or equally distributes his shots, 2) how many of the shots made were in a tight game time, e.g., the point difference with the opponent is within five or less points, 3) the assisted three-pointer field goals percentage, which tells if the player is able to create his own shot, and 4) if the made shot is done in wide-open or being contested. I would consider applying a multiple linear regression model with at least all of the above four factors included as predictors. The response variable for my model could be either the number of wins in a season or the average point the team could score in a game. That is because I always believe that on evaluating a player's value, whether he's a shooter or not, we shall always consider how can he help the team win. 
 

**PART (b):** If you had to choose today without doing any further research, would you pick player A or player B? Why? Please limit your response to no more than 2 sentences.

**ANSWER 15 (b):**   Player A will be my choice, as the data appears to tell me he is more capable to create his own shot, considering there's not much difference in the field goal percentage. However, if I could, I would strongly suggest not to evaluate a player simply based on a point of the data. 


### Question 16  

**QUESTION:** You are studying offensive rebounding as part of your job as Data Analyst with an NBA team. You are trying to create a model that will help predict when there will be an offensive rebound. 

Your first model is a GBM (gradient boosted machine) that includes the location data (at the time the ball hits the rim) and height for all 10 players on the floor. It outputs a prediction for the percentage chance each player will collect the rebound.   

Your second model is a logistic regression model that includes the shot distance, the number of players who crash the boards, and the distance to the rim for the closest two offensive and defensive players. This model outputs a prediction for the percentage chance the offensive team secures the rebound.  

In no more than 4 sentences, how would you decide which model to move forward with? Why?  

**ANSWER 16:**    I might go with GBM as the response variable it delivers, the percentage of each player will collect the rebound, is considered more flexible for coaches to plan the team's second chance offense or transition defense. Coaches can base on each player's percentage of getting the rebound and his shooting range/defensive ability to best decide who shall go for the offensive rebound and who shall prepare for the defense. However, I would prefer trying more predictors, e.g., the player's speed or how high/quick a player can jump, for both models before making my final call if I am really given the responsibility. 


### Question 17  

**QUESTION:** Your coach hears about the project and is interested in the tradeoffs between offensive rebounding and transition defense. He asks you to expand the research you have been doing into a study to help him determine when/how many players he should send to crash the offensive boards.  

How would you use one of the models described above to answer the question for the coach? (Please select one of the two models to write about for this portion of the question.) What other research would be necessary to effectively answer this question for the coach? Describe, in general terms, your plan to answer the coach's question and what you would plan to present to him. Please answer this question in no more than 6 sentences.

**ANSWER 17:**  In addition to the GBM model mentioned above, I would also build two models for predicting the scores we could have in the following second chance offense and the scores we might allow in the following transition defense. These two models might be hierarchical models with each of the 29 teams in the league as the group variable. I would present to the coach with the net scores we could possibly have in this position, which is the points gained in the second chance offense minus the points allow in the potential transition defense. I would suggest the coach to go with the strategy that results in the highest net scores for the team. The details of my strategy shall include which kinds of players, e.g., based on their positions, shall go for the offensive rebound, who shall stand by at the three-point line, and who shall prepare for the transition defense.
