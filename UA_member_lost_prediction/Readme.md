### Business Case

A marketing manager is planning a new campaign designed to increase customer retention. Their plan is to deliver the campaign to a targeted audience defined as customers who are likely to abandon the brand within six months. You have been asked to develop a model which can identify these customers.

### Data

The dataset provided is a snapshot of consumer purchase history taken in mid-June. Customers who made no additional purchases during the six months following the snapshot period were assigned a `churn` value of 1, to indicate that they had abandoned the brand.

No data dictionary was given with this file.
There are no additional measurements that the manager can reliably provide, so your model must be built using only the information you've been provided here.
