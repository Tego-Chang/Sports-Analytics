# Project-DukePlayersAvgPPG-GCP-Big-Query
In this project, we investigate the public dataset, ncaa_basketball, by applying fundamental SQL commands in Big Query of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to explore the glory of Duke MBB.

There are many tables in this dataset, and we would like to use the “mbb_players_games_sr” to help us understand Duke players’ average point per game (PPG).
